<p name="abstract" id="abstract">
<b><i>Abstract:</i></b> A recommendation system is important in e-commerce when sales revenue will be increased if e-commerce websites can provide customers with favorite products (items). It is expected that customers will like and then buy these recommended products. There are two popular algorithms for recommendation such as collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF). CBF recommends an item to a user if such item is similar to other items that she/he likes much in the past (her/his rating for such item is high). CF recommends an item to a user if her/his neighbors (other users similar to her/him) are interested in such item. Both of them have own strong points and drawbacks. This proposed invited session focuses on CF because CF can discover implicit items under community which can be introduced to customers. Moreover, it is not necessary to store heavy information about items that CBF requires. The proposed invited session is named “Collaborative Filtering for Recommendation System” (<b>CF4RS</b>). 
CF4RS has two goals:
<ol>
<li>
Hudup* framework which is a framework of e-commercial recommendation algorithms is introduced. Although Hudup framework supports both CF, CBF, and other algorithms, its strong built-in algorithms are CF algorithms. Via Hudup framework, we will prove effectiveness and feasibility of CF in recommendation system.
</li> 
<li>
Some new researches about CF are presented in CF4RS. Algorithms in these researches are implemented and tested on Hudup framework. 
</li> 
</ol>
<i>
* Note, Hudup framework was finished and accepted by European Project Space (http://www.ic3k.org/EuropeanProjectSpace.aspx?y=2015) in 2015. It was introduced at the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (IC3K 2015), at Lisbon, Portugal, November 13, 2015. Since 2015 it has been improved many times and now it has been developed as extended Hudup framework which gives more support to remote service. Hudup framework is available at http://www.hudup.net<br/>
</i>
<br/>
The motivation of the invited session on <i>“Collaborative Filtering for Recommendation System (CF4RS)”</i> is to make scientific contributions to the area of recommendation information system and to disseminate Hudup framework.
